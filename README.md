# Biography

I am a postdoc working in the area of natural language semantics and pragmatics.
Currently, I am a fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt foundation at [ZAS](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/) in Berlin.
I am interested in the semantics/pragmatics interface in a general way, and in particular the mechanisms of exhaustification, the semantics of questions, and the role of alternatives in meaning.

I completed my Ph.D. at [Institut Jean Nicod](http://www.institutnicod.org/?lang=en) in Paris, under the supervision of [Benjamin Spector](https://sites.google.com/site/bspectorpage/Home). Before getting into linguistics, I studied theoretical computer science and machine learning.

My name is pronounced /emil ɑ̃gø.aʁ/.

You can find my academic CV [here](pdf/cvenguehard.pdf).
